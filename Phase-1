Phase-1 DnC vs DP comparision



Divide and Conquer | Dynamic Programming
------------ | -------------
The top-down approach is to divide and conquer | Dynamic programming is a bottom-up approach to programming
Recursion is preferred by divide and conquer | Iteration is preferred in dynamic programming
In DnC, sub problems are independent | Sub problems are dependent and overlapping
It divides input at a given point | It divides input at every feasible place
Divide and Conquer provides simple solutions | Solution using dynamic programming is complex and tricky
Less efficient, due to modifications | Efficient due to the saving of solution
Solutions of sub problems are not stored | Solutions of sub problems are stored in the table
Single decision sequence is generated | Multiple decision sequences generated 

Dynamic Programming is based on Divide-and-Conquer and it can be applied only when the problem has optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems.
