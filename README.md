*About Misbah:* 
--------------------
I'm currently studying in 7th semester with and doing FYP based on Hardware,Computer Science is something I'm interested in studying because it fascinates me. Computer games drew me in as a child, and later programming drew me in as an adult. I enjoy math and physics as well, but I picked computing as my vocation due of its flexibility, modernity, and variety of problems.
My side hobbies are playing Hockey and games like C.S and Pubg.
